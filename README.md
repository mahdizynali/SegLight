## Light Semantic Segmentation
Approch of this project is implementing light weight semantic segmentation model which has the least inference time as possible on cpu that we use on humanoid soccer robots. Also network architecture has been inspired from our last team project.
## How to use
first of all you have to prepare suitable semantic dataset as images and labels files in dataset directory like bellow :
```
datase/
  |_ /images/
  |_ /labels/
  |_ classes.json (if you want !)
```
